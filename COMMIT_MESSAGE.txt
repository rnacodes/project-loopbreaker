Add password protection with dual environment support

Implemented environment-based authentication using Render Projects & Environments:
- Production environment requires login (VITE_DEMO_MODE=false)
- Demo environment is publicly accessible (VITE_DEMO_MODE=true)
- Same codebase deploys to both environments automatically

Frontend Changes:
- Created ProtectedRoute component for authentication requirement
- Created ConditionalProtectedRoute for environment-based protection
- Updated App.jsx to wrap all private routes with ConditionalProtectedRoute
- Kept /login and /demo as public routes

CI/CD:
- Added GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- Automated testing, deployment, and verification
- Single workflow deploys to both production and demo

Infrastructure:
- Updated render.yaml with complete project definition
- Configured two environments with separate databases
- Environment Groups for scoped variables
- Protected production environment with network isolation

Documentation:
- Created RENDER_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md for step-by-step Render setup
- Created IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md for overview
- Comprehensive documentation in temp-docs/pipelines-and-typesense/

Security Features:
- Protected production environment (admin-only modifications)
- Network isolation between environments
- Separate databases prevent data mixing
- Environment-scoped variables prevent credential mix-ups
- HTTPS enforced on all endpoints

Next Steps:
- Follow RENDER_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md to configure Render
- Create databases and environment groups
- Deploy services to both environments
- Configure DNS and GitHub Secrets
