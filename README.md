## Overview

My MediaVerse is a comprehensive personal media library management application designed to help you track, organize, and discover content across multiple media formats. Whether you're tracking books you've read, podcasts you're listening to, movies on your watchlist, or articles you've saved, My MediaVerse brings everything together in one unified platform. 

I created My MediaVerse after years of trying to organize my entertainment options, and not finding any existing tools that had the exact functionality that I wanted. I found platforms that would support specific types of media, such as movies, but none that could bring all of my options together. The placeholder name "Project Loopbreaker" partially came about because it's very easy to fall into a loop of pointless phone scrolling if you can't decide what you want to do - but having everything in one place could help avoid that. If I'm bored, I can just pull up one of my mixlists for the topic I'm interested at the time, and easily find something to read, watch, or listen to.

### Who is it for?

- **Avid media consumers** who want to track their consumption across multiple formats
- **Note-takers** who want to connect their reading highlights and notes to source material
- **Curators** who enjoy creating themed collections (mixlists) of diverse content
- **Knowledge workers** who want to integrate their Obsidian notes with their media library

---

## Features

### Media Library Management

- **8 Media Types Supported:** Books, Podcasts (shows and episodes), Movies, TV Shows, YouTube (Videos, Channels, and Playlists), Articles, Websites, and Notes
- **Status Tracking:** Mark items as Uncharted, In Progress, Consumed, or Did Not Finish
- **Rating System:** Rate content with SuperLike, Like, Neutral, or Dislike
- **Classification:** Organize with genres and topics for better discoverability
- **Personal Notes:** Add custom notes and link to external documentation
- **Ownership Tracking:** Track whether you own, want to buy, or have borrowed items

## Architecture

My MediaVerse follows **Clean Architecture** principles with a layered structure that promotes separation of concerns and testability.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Web.API Layer             │  Controllers, Middleware, Filters
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Application Layer           │  Services, Business Logic, Interfaces
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Domain Layer              │  Entities, Domain Models
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       Infrastructure Layer          │  EF Core, External API Clients
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Shared Layer              │  DTOs, Utilities, Common Interfaces
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **Clean Architecture:** Dependencies flow inward, with the domain at the center
- **Domain-Driven Design:** Rich domain models with business logic
- **SOLID Principles:** Single responsibility, dependency injection throughout
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstracted data access
- **Service Layer:** Business logic separated from controllers

## Demo Site

**Live Demo:** [https://demo.mymediaverseuniverse.com](https://demo.mymediaverseuniverse.com)

The demo site runs in **read-only mode** by default, allowing you to explore the interface and features without modifying data. Sample data is included to demonstrate all media types and functionality.

---

## Testing

### Run All Tests

```powershell
.\run-all-tests.ps1
```

### Backend Tests Only

```bash
dotnet test src/ProjectLoopbreaker/ProjectLoopbreaker.sln
```

### Frontend Tests Only

```bash
cd frontend
npm test        # Watch mode
npm run test:run    # Single run
