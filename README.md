# ProjectLoopbreaker - Version 1.2

Project Loopbreaker is an in-progress .NET 8 web API comprehensive media library management system with options to manually add items or fetch them using external APIs. The program is designed to help users manage and organize their media consumption across multiple content types. Each media item has its own profile page with thumbnail and content information. The organization system is based around "mixlists," which are themed user-created playlists that can contain any type of media or utilize any criteria.

## Features
